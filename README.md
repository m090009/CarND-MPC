## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

## Preprocessing and Polynomial Fitting

### Preprocessing
Here I mainly transform the waypoints to vehicle space

### Polynomial Fitting
I fit the newly obtained waypoints fit them to  1 dimension using `polyfit()` .


## Latency
The project adds a **100 milliseconds **delay between the
