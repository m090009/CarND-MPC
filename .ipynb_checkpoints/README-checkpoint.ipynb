    "# CarND-MPC\n",
    "In the is project I try to navigate through the lake track yet another time, but this time I'll be using MPC to guide the vehicle.  MPC deals with the problem of following a trajectory by optimizing the acctuator values to acheive the optimal trajectory, this is different from other contollers such as the PID. MPC will control the steering angel delta δ as well as the acceleration which is controlled by the throttle.\n",

    "## The Model\n",
    "MPC works on optimizing the error for each N steps of dt duration. I used a simple kinematic bicycle model which accounts for the vehicle heading, but its not a complicated model that accounts for tire friction and others variables. Here is the formula of the model:\n",

First I translate the values around the origin and align the x axis to the heading of the car. \n",

    "I fit the newly obtained vehicle space waypoints to a 3rd order polynomial using `polyfit()` method at line *line `50`* of the [`main.cpp`](./src/main.cpp), here I used 3 order polynomyal rather than the 1st order that was used in the lectures to have a better curveier fit rather than a linear one because its not a linear model ."

    "## Latency\n",
    "The project adds a **100 milliseconds ** delay for setting the acctuator values, this counts as **2** steps for the chosen **dt** `2 * 0.005 = 0.1 seconds`. Now we need to account for the delay cause if we use the model as it is we'll  always be a **100 ms** (2 time steps) late which could have catastrophic consiquences in the real world and crash in the simulator at high speeds. So I kept track of previous acctuator values for the duration of the latency which in turn includes it in the optimization and negates the effect of the latency. I had to increase most of the indeices by 2 to account for the latency. \n",

    "\n",
    "Here I added a penlty as the Tuning MPC part of the MPC lesson suggested. I used multiple values `[100, 500, 600, 700]` and observed their steering values as you can see in the figures below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 100 \n",
    "![Graph](./imgs/steer_pen_100.png)\n",
    "Here the car crashed after **146** steps, so I knew I had to do better.\n",
    "### 500 \n",
    "![Graph](./imgs/steer_pen_500.png)\n",
    "Here its a farcry from the previous value and the car drives really well around the track without crashing.However, in the lesson it was said that by increasing the value we can get a smoother result so I kept going.\n",
    "### 600\n",
    "![Graph](./imgs/steer_pen_600.png)\n",
    "And here is the result for the value of **600** smoother than **500**, but not by much so lets go higher.\n",
    "### 700\n",
    "![Graph](./imgs/steer_pen_700.png)\n",
    "This one is a bit better than **600** and 2 bits better than **500** and the car drives even smoother, so I'm going to stop here and hope fully test higher numbers later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "They all look alike dont they, well all except for 100 which crashed; however, if we look closer we can see that by increasing the value we get a smoother transission as you can see here:\n",
    "\n",
    "500| 600|700|\n",
    "---|:--:|:--:\n",
    "![Graph](./imgs/zoomed_500.png)|![Graph](./imgs/zoomed_600.png)|![Graph](./imgs/zoomed_700.png)|\n",
    "\n",
    "So thats why I stuck with **700** as a correction or smoothening value. I noticed that everytime we increase the value the peak values go a little higher, so as increasing the value is good for smoothening it elongates the peaks in order to get a smoother turn which could be a problem with higher values."
